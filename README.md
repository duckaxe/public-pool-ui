## Public Pool UI

The user interface for the [Public Pool](https://github.com/benjamin-wilson/public-pool) adapted for use on Umbrel.


### Motivation

The Public Pool UI on Umbrel has not been changed for a year. It was time to update the interface, fix some bugs, and make improvements. Then, pack it all into a Docker container and submit the image to the Umbrel App Store.
